## Capstone Project: Reproduction and discussion of the paper 'On a Mathematical Model of the Carbon Cycle in Nature' by Erriksen and Welander (1955) ##
This repository contains a single jupyter notebook 'project.ipynb' containing a thorough discussion and exploration of the model formulated in https://a.tellusjournals.se/articles/3721/files/658bdf3a41619.pdf. All the results given
in the reference are validated and future scope of a similar study is discussed. Following is a brief abstract:
### Abstract ###
The mathematical model of the carbon cycle proposed by Eriksson and Welander concerns the dynamic interactions between various carbon reservoirs in the Earth's system, such as the atmosphere, ocean, and biosphere. The model aims to quantify the exchange processes and feedback mechanisms that govern the flow of carbon, providing insights into the possibility of self-sustained oscillations and their implications for long-term environmental changes. Reproducing this model is crucial to validate its assumptions, propositions and results under contemporary computational frameworks. This project aimed to faithfully reproduce the results presented in the original study, motivated by a personal interest in mathematical modeling and its applications to diverse fields, including tackling pressing global challenges such as climate change.
